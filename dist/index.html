    "Trust me. I tell everybody it's better to do it yourself and let the indies come after you instead of going their way and getting a deal and you have to wait. It ain't fun. Take it from me. Right now, I'm on MCA, but it feels like I'm an unsigned artist still. It's cool. It's a blessing, but damn I'm like, 'When's my shit gonna come out? I'm ready now, what's up?"
